This is a collection of some handy snippets and resources I collected
which I'm going to be documenting here, it's probably going to be a
mess but it mainly for my reference.

Big thanks to Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan 🙏

## Debugging

From **Adam Wathan:**

> Ever run into annoying CSS layout bugs that are hard to
> troubleshoot? (WHY IS THERE A HORIZONTAL SCROLLBAR WHERE IS THIS
> COMING FROM?!?)

> Throw this style into your dev tools to see the boundaries of every
> element without affecting the layout:

```css
* {
  outline: 1px solid red !important;
}
```

## Images

From **Steve Schoger:**

> Working with images that clash with each other? Try desaturating
> them to greyscale or colourising them all with a single colour to
> make them a little more cohesive.
