The other day a [post from Richard Haines] had me questioning how and
what I write.

Richard's post led me to Chris Biscardi's thoughts on that and in turn
Joel Hooks

Both Joel and Chris mention a post from [Amy Hoy]

Publish all the things

Quite liberated about the not saving things behind a published flag
now.

Even though I have the most ridiculous filing system

Also publish! Like I'm O'Reilly 😂

The content here is primarily for me and if it helps anyone else then
that's a massive plus, you're welcome. 🐱
