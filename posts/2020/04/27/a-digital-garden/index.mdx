I have spent the last two days now questioning how and what I write
after reading a [post from Richard Haines]. In his post he mentioned
how he stumbled across the Digital Garden idea.

Richard's post led me to [Chris Biscardi's thoughts] on that and in
turn Joel Hooks

Both Joel and Chris mention a post from [Amy Hoy] (who I've just
realised I follow on Twitter) in the post Amy talks about the [How the
Blog Broke the Web]

As I'm writing this I'm actually in an Egghead.io Zoom webinar on the
subject.

## Publish all the things

So this is going to work with the notion that I'll write about things
as they come to me, add them here and add to them periodically as an
when needed. This could possibly change after I finish listening to
the Egghead.io webinar.

I'm feeling quite liberated about the not saving things behind a
published flag now.

Even though I have the most ridiculous filing system

Also publish! Like I'm O'Reilly üòÇ

The content here is primarily for me and if it helps anyone else then
that's a massive plus, you're welcome. üê±
