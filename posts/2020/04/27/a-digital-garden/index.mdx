I have spent the last two days now questioning how and what I write
after reading a [post from Richard Haines]. In his post he mentioned
how he stumbled across the Digital Garden idea.

Richard's post led me to [Chris Biscardi's thoughts] on that and in
turn Joel Hooks.

Both Joel and Chris mention a post from [Amy Hoy] (who I've just
realised I follow on Twitter) in the post Amy talks about the [How the
Blog Broke the Web]

As I'm writing this I'm actually in an Egghead.io Zoom webinar on the
subject.

## Publish all the things

I decided that where I write about what I learn doesn't have to be a
job, something else to add to my current cognitive load.

I was a bit hasty about publishing everything on my site, there's no
rush for it to be 'released' though, I'll do it as and when I get
round to it.

I spent some time cleaning up the site however, I removed all
unnecessary cover images and use an Open Graph tool to generate social
sharing cards.

The posts folder on this site before and after I purged all the
assets.

- 70mb folder size with cover images
- 47mb after removing images

I'll go into more detail on this in the upcoming post [Moving from Now
to Netlify then back to Now], I think the title explains a lot of what
the content will be on that one

So this is going to work with the notion that I'll write about things
as they come to me, add them here and add to them periodically as an
when needed.

This could possibly change after I finish listening to the Egghead.io
webinar.

I'm feeling quite liberated about the not saving things behind a
published flag now.

Even though I have the most ridiculous filing system

Also publish! Like I'm O'Reilly üòÇ

The content here is primarily for me and if it helps anyone else then
that's a massive plus, you're welcome. üê±

## Unpublish all the things

It did! I've unpublished a lot of half arsed posts, some just a title
and a link. Sorry if you're reading this and wondering why there's a
post titled **Shaving the Yak!** with the total content of one
sentence and two links!
