That was an incredible PITA (Pain in the Arse)

So what have I learned

Using Renovate may sound like a good idea, everything is kept current

But if you have a lot of projects with a dependency that has high
release rates or that you use in every project (Gatsby, Prettier) then
when update time comes there's a lot of 'busy work' involved.
