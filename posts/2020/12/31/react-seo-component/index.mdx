Here's where I detail what went into making the [React SEO Component].

There wasn't a **great** deal I knew about Search Engine Optimization
before I set about writing the [Build a coding blog from scratch with
Gatsby and MDX] guide that I published last year.

I'd say I know a bit more now but I still feel it's a bit of a black
art.

I made the component to get around having to document the process of
making an SEO component. It was when I was getting toward the end of
writing the guide when I realised that the SEO part of the site was
quite involved.

To begin with I started looking around to see if anyone had created an
SEO component for Gatsby and found a closed [GitHub PR on seo] from
Dustin Schau with some [great notes from Andrew Welch] on SEO and a
link to a presentation he did back in 2017.

## Open Graph

## Twitter

## Facebook

## Component

## Make it a thing

## Resources

Crafting Modern SEO with Andrew Welch is a great video I've shared
before

<Vimeo vimeoId="246846978" />

In the following comments of that PR, Gatsby's [LekoArts] details [his
own implementation] which I have implemented [as a React component],
you're going to be configuring that now in this how-to.
