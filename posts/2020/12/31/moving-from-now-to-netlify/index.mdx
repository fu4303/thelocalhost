I am a massive fan of both Vercel's [Now.sh] platform and the
[Netlify] platform.

This post has been in my drafts since the beginning of March 2019. At
that time it was titled **'Moving from Now to Netlify'** and it was
mostly me being salty about the configuration of the Now service.

At that time I had fallen for Netlify and was swooning over it's super
simple deployments and domain management. That along with it's awesome
caching making your Lighthouse audits something you'd boast about on
Twitter.

Yeah, those people are the _worst_!

Ha! Yes, guilty!

**Anyhoo!** Like the fickle Twitter driven web developer I am,
switching technology every week is expected!

So now I'm back in the [Now.sh] camp. **Why?** I could say it's
because I prefer the new name change from ZEIT to Vercel.

It's not, I could say that it's because Vercel has massively upped
their game in the last two years. They have but it's not that either.

[Netlify] is an awesome platform and I love working with it, I'd
absolutely recommend it to anyone.

## What I'v learned

Try to keep things with as little lock in as possible so you can truly
utilise the content mesh.

- Nothing is zero config
